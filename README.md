## Configure the Platform

### Insight on the initial tasks 

The initial script performs a series of tasks, prior to boot the service. These tasks are:

* Build a configuration file based on environment variables
* Create a self signed certificate
* Configure the identity database
  * Initialize it
  * Create an admin
  * Create oauth clients for the CLI and the console

Certificates are recreated if any SUBJECT_* variable below changes.
Database is reset if DOMAIN, ADMIN_EMAIL, ADMIN_PASSWORD or CONSOLE_SECRET change.
