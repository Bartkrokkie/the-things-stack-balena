# The Things Stack LoRaWAN Network Server with Balena

This project deploys the The Things Stack LoRaWAN Network Server (Open Source Edition) with balena. It runs on a Raspberry Pi (3/4) or balenaFin.

This is a Work In Progress. It should work just fine for local (LAN) deployments, still needs a lot of testing for other environments.

## Getting started

### Hardware

* Raspberry Pi 3/4 or [balenaFin](https://www.balena.io/fin/)
* SD card in case of the RPi 3/4

### Software

* A balenaCloud account ([sign up here](https://dashboard.balena-cloud.com/))
* [balenaEtcher](https://balena.io/etcher)

Once all of this is ready, you are able to deploy this repository following instructions below.

## Deploy the code

### Via [Balena Deploy](https://www.balena.io/docs/learn/deploy/deploy-with-balena-button/)

Running this project is as simple as deploying it to a balenaCloud application. You can do it in just one click by using the button below:

[![](https://www.balena.io/deploy.png)](https://dashboard.balena-cloud.com/deploy?repoUrl=https://github.com/xoseperez/balena-tts-lns)

Follow instructions, click Add a Device and flash an SD card with that OS image dowloaded from balenaCloud. Enjoy the magic ðŸŒŸOver-The-AirðŸŒŸ!


### Via [Balena-Cli](https://www.balena.io/docs/reference/balena-cli/)

If you are a balena CLI expert, feel free to use balena CLI.

- Sign up on [balena.io](https://dashboard.balena.io/signup)
- Create a new application on balenaCloud.
- Clone this repository to your local workspace.
- Using [Balena CLI](https://www.balena.io/docs/reference/cli/), push the code with `balena push <application-name>`
- See the magic happening, your device is getting updated ðŸŒŸOver-The-AirðŸŒŸ!

## Configure the Platform

### Insight on the initial tasks 

The initial script performs a series of tasks, prior to boot the service. These tasks are:

* Build a configuration file based on environment variables
* Create a self signed certificate
* Configure the identity database
  * Initialize it
  * Create an admin
  * Create oauth clients for the CLI and the console

Certificates are recreated if any SUBJECT_* variable below changes.
Database is reset if DOMAIN, ADMIN_EMAIL, ADMIN_PASSWORD or CONSOLE_SECRET change.

#### Variables

Variable Name | Value | Description | Default
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**SERVER_NAME** | `STRING` | Name of the server | The Things Stack
**DOMAIN** | `STRING` | Domain | Defaults to the LAN Ip of the devices
**ADMIN_EMAIL** | `STRING` | Admin email | admin@thethings.example.com
**NOREPLY_EMAIL** | `STRING` | Email used for communications | noreply@thethings.example.com
**ADMIN_PASSWORD** | `STRING` | Admin password (change it here or in the admin profile) | changeme
**CONSOLE_SECRET** | `STRING` | Console secret | console
**DEVICE_CLAIMING_SECRET** | `STRING` | Device claiming secret | device_claiming
**METRICS_PASSWORD** | `STRING` | Metrics password | metrics
**PPROF_PASSWORD** | `STRING` | Profiling password | pprof
**SMTP_HOST** | `STRING` | SMTP Server |  
**SMTP_USER** | `STRING` | SMTP User |  
**SMTP_PASS** | `STRING` | SMTP Password |  
**SENDGRID_KEY** | `STRING` | Sendgrid API Key (SMTP_HOST has to be empty in order to use this) | 
**SUBJECT_COUNTRY** | `STRING` | Self Certificate country code| ES
**SUBJECT_STATE** | `STRING` | Self Certificate state | Catalunya
**SUBJECT_LOCATION** | `STRING` | Self Certificate city | Barcelona
**SUBJECT_ORGANIZATION** | `STRING` | Self Certificate organization | TTN Catalunya


### Add more services

We can merge this project with a BasicStation in the same device. Submodules for the following projects are defined:

* BalenaLabs BasicStation
* WiFi-Connect

To check them out just run after cloning the repo:

```
git module init
```

Finally uncomment the corresponding section on the `docker-compose.yml` file and do a `balena push <application-name>` (see deploy via Balena CLI above).
Check each project documentation to properly configure them.

## Troubleshooting

* Self certificates are not working along with BasicStation unless the device has a domain. Give your Pi a static address and use a local DNS to add a domain pointing to it. Use it in the DOMAIN and TC_URI (for the Balena BasicStation project). Unless the domain definition is available at Google DNS services, you will have to define the DNS Server in the `/mnt/boot/config.json` of the device (not the container, see https://www.balena.io/docs/reference/OS/configuration/#dnsservers).

You can also do it using the Balena CLI on the OS image before burning it to the SD card (you might require sudo, select the drive and DNS server, also type of image):

```
balena config write --type raspberrypi4-64 --drive <downloaded.img> dnsServers "<dns_server>"
```

## TODO

* Lots of testing :)
* Testing performance on different platforms
* Option to use ACME / Let's Encrypt for valid certificates
* Option to configure a connection to the Packet Broker
* Include services to handle a LoRaWAN concentrator
  * Using UDP packet forwarder (currently only comaptible with SX1301 concentrators)
  * Using BasicStation (see troubleshooting section above)
* Check certificate trust on CLI
